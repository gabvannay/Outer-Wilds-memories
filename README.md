# ðŸŒŒ Outer Wilds Memories ðŸŒŒ

## â„¹ Introduction

This is a simple extension for the chromium-based web browsers I made in one afternoon.

The goal is simple: you press a button and get some awesome memories from the beautiful game that **Outer Wilds** is. Sadly, I couldn't find a way to make the music play in the background, so you have to keep the popup open to listen to the music...

But this extension is not on the Chrome Web Store, so if you want to use it, follow the steps below...

## ðŸ‘€ How to install ?

1. Download the ZIP file from this repository (Under **Code**, there's an option **Download ZIP**)
2. Extract the ZIP file on your PC; It doesn't matter where, as long as you can find it
3. In your browser, go at the URL [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) (Your extensions list)
4. Once in there, activate the *"Developer mode"* option
5. You should see a button with something like *"Load unpacked"*. Click on it
6. Choose the folder where you extracted the extension earlier, and you should see a new extension in the list
7. Activate it, and you're good to go!

## âœ¨ How to use ?

1. You first have to choose which song you want, maybe only DLC, maybe only base-game, you can choose !
Options explanations:
   * **Base-game OST** &rArr; Recommended if you haven't played the DLC
   * **DLC OST** &rArr; Self-explanatory...
   * **The Lost Reels** &rArr; It's a collection of songs Andrew Prahlow made that you never hear in game but have multiple connections with other OST. Recommended if you like creepy vibes...

2. You then press the **New tack** button, a random track based on your selections will be chosen.
3. You can now **copy the link** to the video or **open a new tab** with it.
4. Below these options: You'll find the embedded YouTube video, and you can play it there.
